# Zombies Can't Read (Scripts)

A set of C# scripts I created for a first-person zombie survival game made in Unity.

This project features:
- **Endless zombie wave spawning**
- **Perk-based upgrade system** (e.g. Juggernaut, Double Tap)
- **First-person controls with shooting + reloading**
- **UI systems for health, points, shop, and game over**
- **AI for chasing, attacking, and dying**
- **Arrow navigation system pointing to objectives**

> **Note:** This repo contains **code only** â€” no assets are included due to licensing restrictions.  
Feel free to use the code as you wish
